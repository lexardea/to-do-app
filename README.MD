This is a to-do list app created for Coding Temple's end-of-module project using Python.
This is a program designed for the user to create their own to-do list.
Users can add, remove, and view items on their list by selecting these options from the menu.

You will need to run this program in your terminal. 
You start by selecting a number from 1-4 to add or remove a task.
You will receive an error or success message every time you input data.
You can add as many items to your to-do list as you want, but you cannot add a task more than once.

To exit the program, enter 4.
